Page Cost = Extra Pages × $200 to Extra Pages × $500


Subtotal Before Multiplier
Subtotal = Base Cost + Feature Cost + Page Cost


Final Build Cost
Total Build Cost = Subtotal × Builder Multiplier

Example Calculation
Scenario: Small Business website, 8 pages, minor customizations, contact form, built by local freelancer

Base Cost: $2,000 - $10,000 (Small Business)
Design Cost: $500 - $3,000 (Minor customizations)

Multiplier: 1.0x (Local freelancer)
Final Build Cost: $3,100 - $15,000
Annual Cost: $10-$25 (domain) + $50-$1,000 (hosting) + $500-$60,000 (maintenance) = $560 - $61,025
